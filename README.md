# Portfolio (React + Tailwind + Framer Motion)

This is a modern, responsive personal portfolio scaffold using React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

Notes:
- This project uses Vite as the dev server. Tailwind requires `postcss` and `autoprefixer`.
- Replace placeholder images, links, and email addresses with your own content.
